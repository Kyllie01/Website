                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi! I'm Jay Llyod Kylle Alduhesa, a 24-year-old student from Gala, Ozamis City. I'm currently in my 3rd year of pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) at Tangub City Global College. My journey in the field of technology has been an exciting and fulfilling one.</p>
                <p>When I'm not diving into my studies, I enjoy expressing my creativity through singing and dancing. These hobbies have always been a big part of my life, providing a balance between academics and fun. Additionally, I love playing online games, where I get to explore new worlds, strategize, and connect with friends.</p>
                <p>I am passionate about learning new things and look forward to what the future holds as I continue my path in technology. Feel free to explore more about my interests and experiences on this site!</p>
